# However we actually *want* to use the pre-resources version of streams
# so we should refer to the now-archived wasi-poll repo

# Pin to pre-resources version of wasi:io/streams
#
# This is necessary because functions like read under wasi:io/streams
# are no longer available as top level functions, they're under
# resources (ex. `input-stream`) instead
io = "./overrides/io" # Pin to newer version of streams contract
